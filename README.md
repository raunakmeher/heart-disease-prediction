# Heart Disease Prediction using Machine Learning

This project uses machine learning models (Random Forest and Logistic Regression) to predict the likelihood of heart disease based on patient data.
0- no disease 1-disease
## Project Features
- Preprocessed clinical data (age, cholesterol, etc.)
- Trained and evaluated two models: Random Forest and Logistic Regression
- Compared model accuracies to determine the best performer
- Used a separate test file to simulate real-world predictions

## Tech Stack
- Python
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- Jupyter Notebook

## Results
- Random Forest achieved an accuracy of 100.0%
- Logistic Regression achieved an accuracy of 86.66666666666667%
