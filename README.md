# Heart Disease Prediction using Machine Learning

This project uses machine learning models (Random Forest and Logistic Regression) to predict the likelihood of heart disease based on patient data.

## Project Features
- Preprocessed clinical data (age, cholesterol, etc.)
- Trained and evaluated two models: Random Forest and Logistic Regression
- Compared model accuracies to determine the best performer
- Used a separate test file to simulate real-world predictions

## Tech Stack
- Python
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- Jupyter Notebook / VS Code

## Results
- Random Forest achieved an accuracy of **~XX%**
- Logistic Regression achieved an accuracy of **~YY%**
